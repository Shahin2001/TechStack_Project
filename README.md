This is a simple Employee Management System built using React, React Router, Axios, and a RESTful API powered by Spring Boot. The application allows you to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing employee data. The data is stored in a MySQL database and is fetched using an API.
